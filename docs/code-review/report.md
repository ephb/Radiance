## 1. Introduction

Radiance is a powerful and mature synthetic imaging system that has been in development for many years. Its codebase, primarily written in C, reflects its long history and has served its purpose well. However, to ensure its continued viability and to take advantage of modern hardware and software development practices, a migration to a more modern language and toolchain is recommended.

This code review and modernization plan outlines a path for migrating Radiance to C++17. The key goals of this migration are:

*   **Modernize the codebase:** Leverage the features of C++17 to write more expressive, maintainable, and safer code.
*   **Improve multi-threading:** Replace the existing platform-specific threading implementations with the C++17 standard library for better portability and performance.
*   **Enhance Windows compatibility:** Simplify the build process and reduce platform-specific code to ensure Radiance runs smoothly on Windows.
*   **Boost performance:** Identify and address performance bottlenecks, taking advantage of modern C++ idioms and libraries.
*   **Maintain scientific accuracy:** Ensure that all changes preserve the scientific accuracy of the Radiance simulations.

## 2. Summary of Recommendations

The following is a summary of the key recommendations for modernizing the Radiance codebase:

*   **Build System:** Consolidate the three existing build systems (`makeall`, SCons, and CMake) into a single, modern, cross-platform build system. **CMake is the recommended choice.**
*   **Language Migration:** Incrementally migrate the codebase from C to C++17. This will allow for a gradual transition and minimize disruption.
*   **Threading:** Replace the current mix of `pthreads` and Windows-specific threading APIs with the C++17 standard library (`<thread>`, `<mutex>`, `<future>`, etc.). This will provide a portable and high-performance threading model.
*   **Windows Compatibility:** Leverage CMake and cross-platform libraries to improve Windows support and reduce the amount of platform-specific code.
*   **Performance:** Profile the application to identify performance bottlenecks and use modern C++ features and algorithms to optimize critical code paths.
*   **Testing:** Develop a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure that scientific accuracy is maintained throughout the migration process.

## 3. Build System Analysis

The Radiance project currently has three different build systems, which adds unnecessary complexity and maintenance overhead. This section provides an analysis of each system and a recommendation for consolidation.

### 3.1. Existing Build Systems

1.  **`makeall` script:** A custom shell script ([makeall](https://github.com/LBNL/Radiance/blob/master/makeall)) that drives the build process using `make` and a series of `Rmakefile` files. This is a legacy system that is not easily extensible or portable, especially on Windows.

2.  **SCons:** A Python-based build system that uses `SConstruct` files ([SConstruct](https://github.com/LBNL/Radiance/blob/master/SConstruct)). While SCons is more powerful than the `makeall` script, it is less common in the C++ ecosystem than CMake and has less IDE support.

3.  **CMake:** A modern, cross-platform build system that uses `CMakeLists.txt` files ([CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/LBNL/Radiance/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt)). CMake is the de-facto standard for C++ projects and has excellent support in popular IDEs like Visual Studio, VS Code, and CLion.

### 3.2. Recommendation: Consolidate to CMake

It is strongly recommended to **consolidate all build activities into the CMake build system** and deprecate the `makeall` and SCons systems.

**Justification:**

*   **Cross-Platform:** CMake excels at generating native build files for different platforms (e.g., Visual Studio solutions on Windows, Makefiles on Linux), which is crucial for improving Windows compatibility.
*   **IDE Integration:** CMake is well-supported by all major C++ IDEs, which will improve the developer experience.
*   **Modern C++ Support:** CMake has excellent support for C++17 and later standards, making it the ideal choice for this migration.
*   **Community and Ecosystem:** CMake has a large and active community, with a wealth of documentation and resources available.
*   **Dependency Management:** CMake provides robust mechanisms for finding and managing external dependencies.

## 4. Threading and Concurrency Analysis

Radiance employs a basic form of multi-threading to accelerate certain computations. However, the current implementation is platform-specific and could be significantly improved by migrating to the C++17 standard library.

### 4.1. Current Implementation

The primary example of multi-threading in the codebase is in `src/gen/atmos.c`. This file uses a set of preprocessor macros to provide a cross-platform threading API, switching between the `pthreads` library on POSIX systems and the Windows API on Windows.

Here is a snippet from [`src/gen/atmos.c`](https://github.com/LBNL/Radiance/blob/master/src/gen/atmos.c#L56-L70) that illustrates this approach:

```c
#if defined(_WIN32) || defined(_WIN64)
#include <windows.h>
#else
#include <pthread.h>
#endif

#if defined(_WIN32) || defined(_WIN64)
#define THREAD HANDLE
#define CREATE_THREAD(thread, func, context)                                   \
  ((*(thread) = CreateThread(NULL, 0, (func),          \
                             (context), 0, NULL)) != NULL)
#define THREAD_RETURN DWORD WINAPI
#define THREAD_JOIN(thread) WaitForSingleObject(thread, INFINITE)
#define THREAD_CLOSE(thread) CloseHandle(thread)
#else
#define THREAD pthread_t
#define CREATE_THREAD(thread, func, context)                                   \
  (pthread_create((thread), NULL, (func), (context)) == 0)
#define THREAD_RETURN void *
#define THREAD_JOIN(thread) pthread_join(thread, NULL)
#endif
```

This pattern of wrapping native threading APIs is common in older C codebases, but it has several drawbacks.

### 4.2. Drawbacks of the Current Approach

*   **Limited Portability:** While the current implementation supports POSIX and Windows, it may not work on other platforms. It also relies on the correct preprocessor macros being defined.
*   **Low-Level API:** The raw `pthreads` and Windows APIs are low-level and can be verbose and error-prone to use.
*   **Lack of Modern Features:** The current implementation does not take advantage of modern C++ features like thread pools, futures, or parallel algorithms, which could further improve performance and simplify the code.
*   **Maintenance Overhead:** Maintaining custom wrappers for platform-specific APIs adds to the maintenance burden of the project.

### 4.3. Recommendation: Migrate to C++17 Standard Library

It is strongly recommended to **replace the existing threading implementation with the C++17 standard library's threading facilities**. This includes using `<thread>`, `<mutex>`, `<future>`, and other related headers.

**Justification:**

*   **True Portability:** The C++ standard library provides a truly portable threading API that is guaranteed to work on all compliant C++ compilers and platforms.
*   **Higher-Level Abstractions:** The C++ library offers higher-level abstractions like `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, and `std::future`, which are easier to use and less error-prone than the low-level C APIs.
*   **Improved Readability and Maintainability:** Using standard C++ features will make the code more readable and easier to maintain for C++ developers.
*   **Access to Parallel Algorithms:** C++17 introduces parallel algorithms in the `<algorithm>` header, which can be used to easily parallelize many common operations.
*   **Future-Proofing:** Aligning with the C++ standard will make it easier to adopt future concurrency features as they are added to the language.

## 5. Windows Compatibility Analysis

The Radiance codebase has support for Windows, but it is achieved through a large number of preprocessor directives (`#if defined(_WIN32) || defined(_WIN64)`). This approach, while functional, makes the code harder to read and maintain.

### 5.1. Current State of Windows Support

A search for `_WIN32` and `WIN32` in the `src` directory reveals that platform-specific code is scattered throughout the codebase. This includes code for file I/O, process management, and threading.

While this approach has enabled Radiance to run on Windows, it has several disadvantages:

*   **Code Clutter:** The extensive use of `#ifdef` blocks makes the code harder to read and understand.
*   **Maintenance Burden:** Any changes to platform-specific functionality need to be implemented and tested on each platform separately.
*   **Increased Risk of Errors:** It is easy to introduce bugs by making changes in one branch of an `#ifdef` block and forgetting to update the other.

### 5.2. Recommendation: Improve Windows Compatibility with CMake and Abstraction

The migration to C++17 and CMake provides an excellent opportunity to improve Windows compatibility and reduce the amount of platform-specific code.

**Recommendations:**

1.  **Leverage CMake for Platform Detection:** Use CMake's platform detection capabilities to manage platform-specific compiler and linker flags, rather than relying on preprocessor macros in the code.

2.  **Abstract Platform-Specific Code:** Where platform-specific code is unavoidable, it should be abstracted into separate functions or classes. This will isolate the platform-dependent code and make the rest of the codebase cleaner and more portable.

3.  **Use Cross-Platform Libraries:** For new functionality, prefer to use cross-platform libraries that handle the platform-specific details internally. The C++ standard library itself provides many cross-platform utilities for filesystem, threading, and more.

By following these recommendations, the Radiance codebase can be made more portable, maintainable, and easier to develop for Windows.

## 6. Performance and Scientific Accuracy

A key requirement of this modernization effort is to improve performance without sacrificing the scientific accuracy that Radiance is known for. This section discusses strategies for achieving both of these goals.

### 6.1. Performance Improvements

While the existing C codebase is likely already well-optimized, the migration to C++17 opens up new avenues for performance improvements:

*   **Modern Data Structures and Algorithms:** The C++ standard library provides a rich set of highly optimized data structures and algorithms. Using these can often lead to better performance than custom-rolled implementations.
*   **Memory Management:** The current codebase uses `malloc` and `free` for manual memory management. Migrating to C++ smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) and RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) will not only make the code safer but can also improve performance by reducing memory leaks and fragmentation.
*   **Parallel Algorithms:** As mentioned in the threading section, C++17's parallel algorithms can be used to easily parallelize many computations, leading to significant performance gains on multi-core systems.
*   **Profiling:** Before and after making changes, the application should be profiled to identify performance bottlenecks and ensure that optimizations are having the desired effect.

### 6.2. Maintaining Scientific Accuracy

Ensuring that the scientific accuracy of the simulations is not compromised is of the utmost importance. The following testing strategy is recommended:

1.  **Establish a Baseline:** Before any code is modified, a comprehensive set of baseline results should be generated using the existing implementation. These results will serve as the "ground truth" against which all future changes will be compared.

2.  **Leverage Existing Tests:** The project already has a test suite that can be run with `makeall test`. These tests should be incorporated into the new CMake build system and run regularly.

3.  **Create a Comparison Framework:** A framework should be developed to compare the output of the modernized codebase with the baseline results. This framework should be able to detect even small differences in the output images and data files.

4.  **Floating-Point Precision:** Special care must be taken with floating-point calculations. The migration should ensure that the precision of these calculations is not inadvertently changed.

By following a rigorous, test-driven approach, it is possible to modernize the Radiance codebase while preserving its scientific integrity.

## 7. Optimizing `rtrace`

The `rtrace` application is a critical component of the Radiance suite, and its performance is paramount. This section provides a specific analysis of `rtrace` and offers recommendations for improving its performance, particularly on Windows.

### 7.1. Analysis of the `-n` Option for Parallelism

The `-n` command-line option is intended to specify the number of parallel processes for rendering. However, as noted, this option does not currently work on Windows. The investigation into the source code reveals why:

*   The main function for `rtrace` is in [`src/rt/rtmain.c`](https://github.com/LBNL/Radiance/blob/master/src/rt/rtmain.c), which parses the `-n` option and stores the number of processes in the `nproc` variable.
*   The core logic in [`src/rt/rtrace.c`](https://github.com/LBNL/Radiance/blob/master/src/rt/rtrace.c) checks if `nproc > 1` and, if so, calls `ray_popen(nproc)` to create child processes.
*   The `ray_popen` function and related process management rely on the `fork()` system call, which is a POSIX-specific feature and is not available on Windows. This is why the multi-processing capability is effectively disabled on Windows builds.

### 7.2. Recommendation: A Modern, Thread-Based Approach for `rtrace`

To enable high-performance, parallel execution of `rtrace` on Windows and other platforms, the `fork()`-based process model should be replaced with a modern, thread-based model using the C++17 standard library.

**Proposed Implementation:**

1.  **Thread Pool:** Create a thread pool that manages a number of worker threads equal to the value of the `-n` option (or the number of available hardware cores).
2.  **Task Queue:** Implement a thread-safe task queue to hold the rays that need to be traced.
3.  **Ray Tracing Workers:** Each thread in the pool will pull a ray from the queue, trace it using the existing `rayvalue()` function, and store the result.
4.  **Result Aggregation:** The main thread will be responsible for collecting the results from the worker threads and printing them to the output in the correct order.

This approach has several advantages over the current process-based model:

*   **Cross-Platform:** It will work on any platform with a C++17 compliant compiler, including Windows.
*   **Lower Overhead:** Threads have lower creation overhead and memory footprint compared to processes.
*   **Finer-Grained Control:** A thread-based model offers more sophisticated options for synchronization and data sharing, which can lead to further performance optimizations.

### 7.3. Further Performance Optimizations for `rtrace`

Beyond multi-threading, the migration to C++17 opens the door to other performance enhancements:

*   **SIMD Intrinsics:** For the core ray-object intersection calculations, consider using SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) intrinsics to perform calculations on multiple data points simultaneously.
*   **Memory Layout:** Profile and optimize memory access patterns to improve cache locality. This could involve restructuring data to be more cache-friendly.
*   **Modern C++ Algorithms:** Replace hand-rolled loops with C++17 parallel algorithms where applicable.

By implementing a modern threading model and exploring these additional optimizations, the performance of `rtrace` can be significantly improved, especially on multi-core Windows systems.

## 8. Proposed Migration Plan

This section outlines a high-level, phased approach for migrating the Radiance codebase to C++17. This approach is designed to be incremental, allowing for continuous testing and validation at each stage.

### Phase 1: Build System Consolidation

The first step is to consolidate the build system to CMake, creating a single, reliable foundation for the rest of the migration.

1.  **Enhance CMake Build:** Expand the existing `CMakeLists.txt` files to fully support all features and targets currently handled by the `makeall` and SCons build systems.
2.  **Integrate Testing:** Port the existing test suite (`makeall test`) to CTest, CMake's testing framework.
3.  **Deprecate Legacy Systems:** Once the CMake build is fully functional and validated on all target platforms, the `makeall` script, `Rmakefile` files, and `SConstruct` files should be removed from the project.

### Phase 2: Incremental C-to-C++ Conversion

With a solid build system in place, the process of converting the C code to C++ can begin. This should be done incrementally, one module or library at a time.

1.  **Compiler Switch:** Configure the CMake build to compile the code as C++17. The simplest way to start is by renaming source files from `.c` to `.cpp`.
2.  **Initial Refactoring:** Address the initial compiler errors, which will likely involve replacing C-style casts with C++ casts and ensuring type safety.
3.  **Adopt C++ Idioms:** Gradually introduce modern C++ features:
    *   Replace `malloc`/`free` with smart pointers (`std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`) to manage memory automatically and prevent leaks.
    *   Convert C-style structs that have associated functions into classes with member functions.
    *   Use the C++ standard library's containers and algorithms where appropriate.

### Phase 3: Modernize Threading

Once a significant portion of the codebase has been converted to C++, the threading implementation can be modernized.

1.  **Refactor Threading Code:** Identify all areas that use the custom threading wrappers (e.g., `src/gen/atmos.c`).
2.  **Replace with C++ Standard Library:** Refactor this code to use `std::thread`, `std::mutex`, `std::future`, and other concurrency primitives from the C++17 standard library.
3.  **Introduce Higher-Level Abstractions:** Consider creating a thread pool to manage worker threads efficiently and reduce the overhead of creating and destroying threads.

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization

After the core migration is complete, a dedicated phase should be focused on performance optimization.

1.  **Profile the Application:** Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks in the modernized codebase.
2.  **Apply Parallel Algorithms:** Leverage C++17's parallel algorithms to optimize data-parallel operations.
3.  **Iterate and Test:** Continuously measure the performance impact of optimizations and run the regression tests to ensure that scientific accuracy is not compromised.
